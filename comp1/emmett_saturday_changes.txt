Lecture 13:
In comp1.c - parseWhileStatement:
added backpatching and emit to handle while loop

In comp1.c - parseIfStatement:
added backpatching and emit to handle if statement, this was the only one I wrote from hand,
he gave no documentation for this, just said it was like the ParseWhileStatement except
two Labels needed to be back pactched, have tried moving around the Label2 & BackPatch(L2BackPatchLoc, Label2)
but no luck..
